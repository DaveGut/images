# Hubitat-TTS-Audio-Buffer
Buffers  notification messages for speakers so that messages are not interrupted and desroyed.

Current version is for single speaker only and is considered Beta.  I am working on a version 1 that will allow multiple speakers and has installation/use instructions included.
